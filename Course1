Supervised Learning
X -> Y mappings
Learn from data labeled with "right answers"
1/ Regression algorithm: predict numbers (infinite possible outputs - Continuous) E.g. Linear/ Non-linear regression model
2/ Classification algorithm: predict categories (not necessarily numbers), only finite possible outputs (Discrete)
E.g. breast cancer detection: 3 possible outputs

Unsupervised Learning
Unlabeled: X give the algorithm the "right ans"
Let itself find some pattern in the data
1/ Clustering (grouping)(Panda) algorithm: groups data with same patterns tgt into different clusters
E.g. Recommended articles/ videos on Google/ Youtube < not feasible if done by ppl! 9999 News everyday
2/ Other algorithms will be discussed later


Terminologies
- Training set: Data used to train the model
- Input variable: x
- Output/ target variable: y
- No of training examples: m
- Single training example = (x, y)
- i th training example = (x^(i)$, y^(i)$)
